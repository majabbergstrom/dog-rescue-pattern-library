The buttons use the primary colours and accent colors to stand out among the main content of the pages.
Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards and forms
- The light buttons are for dark areas
- The ghost button is used for secondary banners
- The nav button is used for the navigation or footer links
- The banner button is used on the primary banner. Very similar to ghost button.
- The minimize button is used in the form to collapse expanded sections in the form.
- The expand button is used in the form to expand collapsed sections in the form.

Can be mixed with `font-size` classes to change button size.
